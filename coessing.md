My notes from [COESSING 2023: Make a personal website with GitHub!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhN3Sp6mwz4)

Steps:

1. Find a template you like, for instance [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/)
2. Go to it [GitHub repo](https://github.com/academicpages)
3. Fork it to your repo and name a repo (optional)
